/*
Create a program that prompt user with question:  "Do you need a loan?"(Use a boolean)
If the result is true then prompt user with question: "What is your credit score?". Otherwise, eligibility is "Unknown"
Based on the score define users eligibility:

- if score is below  600 --> eligibility = "Not eligible"
- if score is between 600 and 700 inclusive -->  eligibility = "Maybe eligible"
- if score is between 701 and 800 inclusive -->  eligibility = "Eligible"
- if score is higher than any other previous values --> eligibility = "Definitely eligible" .
